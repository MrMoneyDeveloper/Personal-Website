# Personal Website Games

This site contains small canvas games used on the homepage carousel.

## Controls

- **Tetris** – Arrow keys to move, `Q`/`W` to rotate pieces.
- **Snake** – Arrow keys to move the snake.
- **Breakout** – Use left and right arrows to move the paddle.

Click the **Start** button on any slide to play and **Stop** to halt. Switching slides automatically stops the current game. On small screens, touch arrows appear below each canvas for control.

## 3D Models

Several pages can display lightweight GLB models. Copy your files into `assets/models/` using the exact names listed in that folder's README. The loader scripts will pick them up automatically.
